This code is a script written in Python language and used with the Selenium library. The purpose of this code is to reduce false positive cases in XSS vulnerabilities to zero. It takes two different parameters, urls.txt and xsswordlist.txt. Add the parameters of the URLs you crawled to urls.txt. Add your XSS scripts to xsswordlist.txt, following the "=" sign. The code is also supported by the rate flag. You can specify it as -r 10. You will write your own XSS code for each parameter and communicate with Selenium, and open a window in Firefox. If a popup appears in Firefox, it will write "vulnerable: URL: payload" to the console.


Basic usage: python3 main.py urls.txt xssworldist.txt
